The Narro Engine is a cross-platform RPG engine made with love, dedication, Pygame and Python 3  

Compiling instructions
-----------------------
So you want to build the Narro Engine? How unexpected. There's no doc around here, because it's mostly dedicated to a personal use. But you may have a look at the source code of the games
I've made with it. Try _A Scholar In The Woods_ for instance (https://github.com/Rastagong/A-Scholar-In-The-Woods). If you want to build the engine alone though, let's do it.

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies are installed:
   * *Python 3* must be installed.
   * You need the *Pygame* library. I currently use a pre-release of Pygame 1.9.2, but it should work with Pygame 1.9.1 too. You'll find everything here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.
   * You need NumPy too. 

2. Download the latest source build from the _Releases_ folder.

3. Run "python setup.py build" if you want to install the Narro Engine in a folder, or "python setup.py install" if you want to install permanently in your Python folder. It's done!
